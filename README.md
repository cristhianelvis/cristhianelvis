- 👋 Hi, I’m @cristhianelvis
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff for real! From programming to play some music or even produce random music that will never come out XD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for now Next-js, and before that I was learning React.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on no one for now cause I really suck at programming well I'm learning so it's a given that I suck at it! XD
- 📫 You can try contacting me via e-mail at cristhianelvis@gmail.com
